Below is a detailed plan for a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for a hybrid school management system tailored for Kenyan private schools, incorporating a core version (one-time payment, offline-capable) and a subscription version (SaaS, cloud-based). The MVP focuses on the requested features: notifications and communication to parents/guardians, fee payment management with receipt/slip generation, simple student registration (CRUD linked to parent/guardian phone number and email), and exam and report/results card printing. The system is designed to be simple, scalable, and aligned with Kenya’s market needs, leveraging Next.js, Supabase, AWS Amplify, and M-Pesa integration. I’ll outline the features, tech stack, architecture, implementation steps, and deployment strategy, keeping it concise yet comprehensive.
MVP Overview
Core Version (One-Time Payment):
Price: KSh 30,000–50,000 (one-time).

Features: Offline-capable student registration (CRUD), basic fee payment tracking, receipt generation, and report card printing.

Target: Low-fee private schools (LFPSs) with limited budgets and internet access.

Deployment: Local installation or AWS EC2 for minimal hosting.

Subscription Version (SaaS):
Price: KSh 500/month (basic tier), KSh 2,000/month (premium tier).

Features: All core features plus cloud-based notifications (SMS/email via parent/guardian contact), M-Pesa integration for fee payments, and enhanced report card generation with analytics.

Target: Mid-tier and high-end schools, with a low-cost tier for LFPSs.

Deployment: AWS Amplify with Supabase for scalability.

Hybrid Advantage: Schools start with the core version and upgrade to SaaS for advanced features, ensuring flexibility and broad market appeal.

Features and Requirements
1. Notifications and Communication to Parents/Guardians
Core Version: Offline storage of parent/guardian phone numbers and emails. Manual export of contact lists for SMS/email via external tools (e.g., CSV export for bulk SMS providers like Kenya’s Africa’s Talking).

Subscription Version: Automated SMS/email notifications via Supabase triggers and integrations (e.g., Africa’s Talking for SMS, SendGrid for email). Notify parents about fee deadlines, exam results, or school updates.

Scalability: Supabase’s real-time subscriptions enable instant notifications as the system grows. AWS Lambda can handle high-volume SMS/email sends.

2. Fee Payment Management and Receipt/Slip Generation
Core Version: Offline fee tracking (record payments, amounts, dates). Generate PDF receipts locally using a library like pdfkit. Store data in SQLite.

Subscription Version: M-Pesa integration via Safaricom’s Daraja API for real-time fee payments. Automated receipt generation and delivery via email/SMS. Track payment history with Supabase.

Scalability: M-Pesa API supports high transaction volumes, and Supabase’s PostgreSQL scales for thousands of records. AWS S3 can store generated receipts.

3. Simple Student Registration (CRUD Linked to Parent/Guardian)
Core Version: CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for student records (name, ID, class, parent/guardian phone, email). SQLite database for offline storage. Link each student to a parent/guardian’s contact details.

Subscription Version: Cloud-based CRUD with Supabase, syncing offline data when internet is available. Validate parent/guardian phone/email for notifications.

Scalability: Supabase’s PostgreSQL handles large datasets, and its REST API simplifies CRUD operations across devices.

4. Exam and Report/Results Card Printing
Core Version: Input exam results (subject, score, grade) and generate printable report cards as PDFs using pdfkit. Store results in SQLite.

Subscription Version: Cloud-based result entry and storage in Supabase. Generate dynamic report cards with analytics (e.g., class ranking). Email report cards to parents.

Scalability: Supabase’s real-time features allow instant result updates, and AWS Amplify serves report card PDFs efficiently.

Tech Stack
Frontend: Next.js (React-based, supports SSR and SSG, leverages your intermediate experience).

Backend/Database:
Core Version: SQLite (lightweight, offline-capable database for local storage).

Subscription Version: Supabase (PostgreSQL-based, cloud-hosted, with REST API and real-time features).

Payment Integration: M-Pesa via Safaricom’s Daraja API (subscription version only).

Notifications: Africa’s Talking (SMS) and SendGrid (email) for subscription version; CSV export for core version.

PDF Generation: pdfkit for receipts and report cards (both versions).

Deployment:
Core Version: Local installation (e.g., on school’s PC) or AWS EC2 for minimal hosting.

Subscription Version: AWS Amplify for Next.js hosting, Supabase for database and APIs.

Authentication: Supabase Auth for subscription version; simple local auth (e.g., password-based) for core version.

Why This Stack?
Next.js: Familiar to you, supports both offline and cloud-based apps, and is mobile-optimized for Kenyan users.

Supabase: Simplifies PostgreSQL setup, offers free tier, and integrates M-Pesa and notifications. Scales better than MongoDB for relational data (students, parents, fees).

SQLite: Lightweight for offline use, ideal for LFPSs with poor internet.

AWS Amplify: Easy to deploy Next.js, cost-effective with free tier, and supports Kenya’s variable connectivity.

M-Pesa: Essential for Kenya, where 80% of transactions use mobile money.

bash

npm install @supabase/supabase-js pdfkit mpesa-node axios

Set up Supabase project (free tier) at supabase.com for subscription version.

Configure SQLite for core version using sqlite3 or better-sqlite3.

2. Database Schema (Supabase for Subscription, SQLite for Core)
Tables:
students: id, name, class, parent_phone, parent_email, created_at

fees: id, student_id, amount, date, status, receipt_url

exams: id, student_id, subject, score, grade, date

notifications: id, recipient_phone, recipient_email, message, type, sent_at (subscription only)

Supabase Setup: Create tables via Supabase dashboard or SQL editor. Enable real-time for notifications.

SQLite Setup: Create identical tables locally using SQLite queries.

3. Feature Implementation
Student Registration (CRUD)
Next.js Pages:
/students: List students, search by name or ID.

/students/[id]: View/edit/delete student.

/students/new: Add student with parent/guardian details.

Core Version:
Use SQLite queries in Next.js API routes (e.g., /api/students).

Example:
javascript

// pages/api/students.js
import sqlite3 from 'sqlite3';
const db = new sqlite3.Database('school.db');

export default function handler(req, res) {
  if (req.method === 'GET') {
    db.all('SELECT * FROM students', [], (err, rows) => {
      res.status(200).json(rows);
    });
  }
  // Add POST, PUT, DELETE for CRUD
}

Subscription Version:
Use Supabase client:
javascript

import { createClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js';
const supabase = createClient(process.env.SUPABASE_URL, process.env.SUPABASE_KEY);

export default async function handler(req, res) {
  if (req.method === 'GET') {
    const { data } = await supabase.from('students').select('*');
    res.status(200).json(data);
  }
  // Add POST, PUT, DELETE
}

Validation: Ensure parent phone/email is valid (e.g., Kenyan phone format: +2547XXXXXXXX).

Fee Payment Management and Receipt Generation
Core Version:
Form to log payments (amount, date, student ID).

Generate PDF receipts with pdfkit:
javascript

import PDFDocument from 'pdfkit';
import fs from 'fs';

export default function handler(req, res) {
  const doc = new PDFDocument();
  res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'application/pdf');
  doc.pipe(res);
  doc.text(`Receipt for ${req.body.student_name}, Amount: KSh ${req.body.amount}`);
  doc.end();
  // Save to SQLite: INSERT INTO fees (student_id, amount, date, status)
}

Store receipts locally or in a folder.

Subscription Version:
Integrate M-Pesa Daraja API for payments:
javascript

import { Mpesa } from 'mpesa-node';
const mpesa = new Mpesa({
  consumerKey: process.env.MPESA_CONSUMER_KEY,
  consumerSecret: process.env.MPESA_CONSUMER_SECRET,
  // Other configs
});

export default async function handler(req, res) {
  const { phone, amount } = req.body;
  const response = await mpesa.lipaNaMpesaOnline({
    phoneNumber: phone,
    amount,
    // Other params
  });
  if (response.success) {
    // Save to Supabase: INSERT INTO fees
    // Generate PDF and upload to AWS S3
    res.status(200).json({ message: 'Payment processed' });
  }
}

Store receipts in AWS S3 and send URLs via email/SMS.

Notifications and Communication
Core Version:
Export parent contacts as CSV for external SMS/email tools.

Example:
javascript

export default function handler(req, res) {
  db.all('SELECT parent_phone, parent_email FROM students', [], (err, rows) => {
    const csv = rows.map(row => `${row.parent_phone},${row.parent_email}`).join('\n');
    res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/csv');
    res.send(csv);
  });
}

Subscription Version:
Use Africa’s Talking for SMS and SendGrid for email:
javascript

import AfricasTalking from 'africastalking';
import sendgrid from '@sendgrid/mail';

const at = AfricasTalking({
  apiKey: process.env.AT_API_KEY,
  username: 'your-username',
});

sendgrid.setApiKey(process.env.SENDGRID_API_KEY);

export default async function handler(req, res) {
  const { message, recipients } = req.body;
  // SMS
  await at.sms.send({ to: recipients, message });
  // Email
  await sendgrid.send({
    to: recipients,
    from: 'school@example.com',
    subject: 'School Update',
    text: message,
  });
  // Save to Supabase: INSERT INTO notifications
  res.status(200).json({ message: 'Sent' });
}

Trigger notifications on events (e.g., fee payment, exam results) using Supabase database triggers.

Exam and Report/Results Card Printing
Core Version:
Form to input exam results (subject, score, grade).

Generate PDF report cards with pdfkit:
javascript

export default function handler(req, res) {
  const doc = new PDFDocument();
  res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'application/pdf');
  doc.text(`Report Card for ${req.body.student_name}`);
  doc.text(`Subject: ${req.body.subject}, Grade: ${req.body.grade}`);
  doc.end();
  // Save to SQLite: INSERT INTO exams
}

Subscription Version:
Store results in Supabase.

Generate dynamic report cards with analytics (e.g., average score):
javascript

export default async function handler(req, res) {
  const { data: results } = await supabase.from('exams').select('*').eq('student_id', req.body.student_id);
  const doc = new PDFDocument();
  res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'application/pdf');
  results.forEach(result => doc.text(`${result.subject}: ${result.grade}`));
  doc.end();
  // Email to parent using SendGrid
}

Allow printing via browser or email delivery.

4. Authentication
Core Version: Simple password-based auth stored in SQLite.

Subscription Version: Supabase Auth with email/password or phone-based login for admins/teachers.

Example (Subscription):
javascript

import { createClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js';
const supabase = createClient(process.env.SUPABASE_URL, process.env.SUPABASE_KEY);

export default async function handler(req, res) {
  const { email, password } = req.body;
  const { user, error } = await supabase.auth.signInWithPassword({ email, password });
  if (error) return res.status(401).json({ error });
  res.status(200).json({ user });
}

5. Deployment
Core Version:
Package as a standalone app using next build and electron for desktop use, or deploy on AWS EC2 with SQLite.

Example EC2 Setup:
bash

# Install Node.js, clone repo, run
npm install
npm run build
npm start

Subscription Version:
Deploy Next.js to AWS Amplify:
bash

amplify init
amplify add hosting
amplify publish

Connect to Supabase via environment variables in Amplify.

M-Pesa Setup: Register for Safaricom Daraja API, configure sandbox for testing, and move to production after approval.

Scalability Considerations
Database: Supabase’s PostgreSQL scales to thousands of students/fees. SQLite is sufficient for small schools but can be migrated to Supabase for growth.

Performance: AWS Amplify’s CDN ensures fast load times, critical for Kenya’s variable internet. Cache static assets (e.g., report card templates) in S3.

Notifications: Africa’s Talking and SendGrid handle high-volume SMS/email, with rate limits managed via AWS Lambda.

M-Pesa: Daraja API supports high transaction volumes, but implement retry logic for network issues.

Offline Sync: For hybrid functionality, store offline data in SQLite and sync to Supabase when online using a queue system (e.g., bull.js).

Development Timeline (MVP)
Week 1: Set up Next.js, Supabase, and SQLite. Design database schema. Build student CRUD.

Week 2: Implement fee management and M-Pesa integration (subscription). Add PDF receipt generation.

Week 3: Build exam result entry and report card generation. Integrate notifications (SMS/email for subscription, CSV export for core).

Week 4: Add authentication. Test offline/online modes. Deploy to AWS Amplify (subscription) and test EC2/local setup (core).

Total: ~4 weeks for a solo developer with intermediate Next.js skills.

Cost Estimates
Development:
Your time: ~160 hours (4 weeks full-time).

Tools: Supabase free tier, AWS Amplify free tier (first year), Africa’s Talking (KSh 1/SMS), SendGrid ($15/month for 50,000 emails).

Core Version:
Deployment: ~KSh 5,000/month for EC2 (if hosted) or free for local installation.

Subscription Version:
Hosting: AWS Amplify (KSh 1,000–5,000/month based on usage), Supabase ($10/month for basic tier).

Notifications: ~KSh 1,000/month for 1,000 SMS/emails.

Revenue Potential:
50 LFPSs at KSh 30,000 = KSh 1.5 million (one-time).

20 mid-tier schools at KSh 2,000/month = KSh 480,000/year.

Low-cost SaaS tier (50 LFPSs at KSh 500/month) = KSh 300,000/year.

Advice and Next Steps
Start with the Subscription Version: Focus on the SaaS MVP using Next.js, Supabase, and AWS Amplify, as it’s scalable and aligns with your skills. Add M-Pesa integration early, as it’s critical for Kenya.

Build Core Version Later: Use SQLite for offline functionality to target LFPSs. Implement sync logic to allow upgrades to SaaS.

Prioritize M-Pesa and Notifications: These are dealmakers for Kenyan schools. Test Daraja API in sandbox mode and secure Africa’s Talking/SendGrid accounts.

Test with Schools: Pilot the MVP with 2–3 schools (1 LFPS, 1–2 mid-tier). Offer a free trial for SaaS to gather feedback. Validate pricing (KSh 30,000 for core, KSh 500–2,000/month for SaaS).

Market Locally: Use email (92% of schools use it) and WhatsApp groups to reach owners. Highlight M-Pesa integration and offline capability for LFPSs.

Iterate Post-MVP: Add features like attendance tracking or class scheduling based on feedback. Scale to more schools using AWS’s elasticity.

Immediate Actions
Set Up Tools: Create accounts for Supabase, AWS Amplify, Africa’s Talking, SendGrid, and Safaricom Daraja.

Code Student CRUD: Start with the /students page and Supabase integration (use the code snippets above).

Test M-Pesa: Implement a basic payment flow in sandbox mode.

Deploy Early: Push a simple version to Amplify to test hosting.
